Welcome to my inaugural project, the ICT Academy Website. This web endeavor boasts a sleek design complemented by a user-friendly interface. Notable features include an easily navigable header, a succinct section extolling the academy's benefits, a straightforward login form, and concise descriptions of key courses. The footer rounds off the design with a copyright notice for the year 2023. As my first website, this project aims to serve as a foundational and informative platform, showcasing my proficiency in HTML and CSS. Explore the dynamic elements that make the ICT Academy Website an engaging online presence, from its aesthetically pleasing visuals to its seamless user experience.
